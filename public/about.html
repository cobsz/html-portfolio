<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a hard worker, although very short on time, as I have a small family,I love to spend time with them, however this doesn't leave a lot of time left for learning how to code.</p>

<p>I like to play games online with friends, spend time with my family and bring positivity to my family, friends and life.</p>

<p>I hope that during the course I can improve my understanding significantly, then use that to help spend more time with them all.</p>
